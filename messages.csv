To understand Korea, one must look at how it differs from the US and Japan—specifically in its transition from a 'Statutory Vacuum' to a 'Hard' Soft Law regime.  Unlike Japan’s strict codification or the US’s regulation-by-enforcement, Korea has operated in a gray zone where the FSC exerts 'window dressing' control via oral instructions and administrative guidance.  Most recently, I presented a briefing to members of the Korean National Assembly on blockchain policy, specifically addressing the current BOK vs. FSC deadlock over stablecoin issuance. My focus was on how the proposed '51% Bank Rule' (requiring bank-majority consortiums) might stifle the very innovation that made Korea a global crypto leader.  I believe these nuances—the 'Soft Law' grip and the inter-agency friction over monetary sovereignty—are the most critical takeaways for an international audience. I look forward to sharing more about my work with the National Assembly and how these shifts impact global platforms when we connect.",INBOX,,No

After the Russian Revolution, he lost all contact with his family and emigrated to France in 1920. Upon arrival, his surname was slightly altered by the French authorities, who added an “e” at the end, making it Glamazdine. In Paris, he met my grandmother, Antonina Bukhetov, who was originally from Estonia but of Russian descent. Together, they had a son—my father, Michel Glamazdine. Since our family name is quite rare, even in Russia, I believe there is a strong possibility that we may be related. I would be truly grateful if you could let me know whether you or your family have ever heard of a relative who emigrated to France after the Russian Revolution.
